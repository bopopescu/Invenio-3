python-poppler has two bugs which have not been fixed for a few years.

document_new_from_data() arg1 must be without null bytes
  https://bugs.launchpad.net/poppler-python/+bug/312462

python-poppler doesn't close files
  https://bugs.launchpad.net/poppler-python/+bug/316722

The first bug does not allow to load binary pdf data into poppler. Due to
automatic binding generation the data is expected to be a null terminated
string. However, binary pdf data can contain zero bytes.

The latter one also introduces memory leaks because the python object is
free'd but the corresponding C memory is not.

Download the python-poppler code from
  https://launchpad.net/poppler-python/
and fix both of these bugs by applying
  poppler.defs.patch
  poppler.override.patch
to the corresponding files using the patch tool.

Then follow the python-poppler README/INSTALL to compile and install the fixed
python-poppler lib.

NOTES:
The patches remove the length parameter from
poppler.document_new_from_data(pdfdata, password) as python can manage the
length of strings containing null bytes by itself.
